<h1 id="please-dont-call-me-directly-on-teams">Please Don’t Call Me Directly on Teams</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Modern digital communication should respect the time and attention of all participants. <strong>Don’t call someone out of the blue on Teams</strong>. Similarly, <strong>avoid sending vague messages like</strong> <code>Hi XXX, call?</code>. Instead, <strong>provide context, check availability, and request a call</strong>. This allows for a more efficient and considerate exchange of information.</p>
<h2 id="call-etiquette">Call Etiquette</h2>
<pre class="text"><code>2024-08-15 14:00:00 you: [Incoming call]
2024-08-15 14:00:05 co-worker: (In call) Hi, can we talk about [something]?
# YOU ARE INTERRUPTED AND HAVE TO DROP WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING</code></pre>
<p>It’s like someone barging into your office unannounced!</p>
<p>Or this scenario:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2024-08-15 14:00:00 you: Hi XXX, call?
# CO-WORKER IS LEFT WONDERING ABOUT THE CONTEXT AND URGENCY</code></pre>
<p>Both situations are disruptive and inconsiderate.</p>
<p>Please do this instead:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2024-08-15 14:00:00 you: Hi XXX -- I need to discuss [something specific]. Do you have time for a quick call?
2024-08-15 14:01:30 co-worker: Sure, how about at 3 PM?</code></pre>
<p>Note that this approach respects your colleague’s time and allows them to prepare for the conversation.</p>
<p>Unsolicited calls or vague messages can be highly disruptive. Unlike scheduled meetings or detailed messages that allow for some degree of preparation, an unplanned call or unclear message demands immediate attention or leaves the recipient uncertain about the urgency and context.</p>
<p>If you feel it’s necessary to initiate contact before scheduling a call, try something like this:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2024-08-15 14:00:00 you: Hi XXX -- I&#39;m working on [specific task] and need your input. Do you have time for a quick call later today? When would be convenient for you?</code></pre>
<p>This method provides context and respects the recipient’s current commitments.</p>
<h2 id="respecting-communication-preferences">Respecting Communication Preferences</h2>
<p>Don’t assume that because someone is online, they are available for a voice or video call. Presence status can be misleading; they might be in the middle of focused work or another meeting.</p>
<p>Instead of making an unsolicited call or sending vague messages like “Hi XXX, got a sec?”, consider phrasing your request clearly:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>2024-08-15 14:00:00 you: Hi XXX - I&#39;m working on [specific task] and need your input. Do you have X minutes later today to discuss? Let me know when would work best for you.</code></pre>
<p>This approach does three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It sets clear expectations regarding the duration.</li>
<li>It provides context so the recipient knows what to expect.</li>
<li>It allows both parties to find an optimal time without causing disruption.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these guidelines, we can foster a more respectful and productive communication culture within our teams.</p>
